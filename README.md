## Overview
This task is an on-the-job ticketâ€”meaning that i began with starter code that I need to modify.
Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular assignment, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub Pages
- FontAwesome
- ...more

## My process
Make it accessible
- Possibly refactor CSS code
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Include comments
- Make sure the page has a logical structure (title, header, body, footer)
- There should be a logical order to headings (h1->h6)
- Ensure there are alt attributes for all images and keep it descriptive
- Document title (head element) should be descriptive
- Search Engine Optimisation nav link is broken (fix it)
- Remove duplicate class names in CSS and replace with generic class name in HTML
